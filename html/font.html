    <h3 style="font-variant: small-caps; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: ;">In this example, the .container div has position: relative, which makes it the nearest positioned ancestor of the .box div. The .box div has position: absolute, which takes it out of the normal flow of the page and positions it 50 pixels from the top and 50 pixels from the left of the .container div. The width and height properties define the size of the box, and the background-color property sets the background color to red.

        It's important to note that when an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal document flow, which can affect the layout of other elements on the page. Additionally, because the position is based on the nearest positioned ancestor, it's important to make sure that the ancestor is positioned correctly.</h3>
